We want to be able to snap the robot to a specific heading
The reef has 6 sections of wall we can score points on.  We want to be able to line up the heading (left/right spin) of the robot to these locations

Task 1: We want to make sure that we can get the robot to snap to any heading.  Lets try 90 degrees as an example.
YAGSL has some built in stuff for this.  Here are the first things I would try.  You can take a look at the YAGSL methods in our code to learn more about them

Option1: driveToPose(new pose(parameters))_
    i think there is a .getPose() method you can use to get the robots pose...

Option2: setHeading()
    make a setheading method using drivetopose and a target heading


Expected outcome: the robot snaps to any new heading.  IT's fine if this isnt the degree amount you want it to.

Task2: now we need to make sure that the snaping we are doing is good.
make another button bind that snaps to heading of 0

Expected outcome: you have a button that sets heading to 90 degrees, and sets heading to 0 degrees.  The robot front should consistently snap to a 90 degree difference


Task3: now we need to see what is actually useful on the field.  Get the angles from the field cad (prefered), or measure out our reef and see what works.
Then incorporate 2 heading snaps that would be useful in an actual match.

Expected outcome.  We test the robot on the field and it snaps the heading to 2 different headings around the reef and we are (left/right spin) lined up
